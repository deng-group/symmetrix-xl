# Apple Metal (macOS)

The `metal` branch adds an Apple GPU backend for FP32 MACE evaluation on Apple silicon Macs. The radial, product-basis, and interaction stages run as native Metal kernels on the GPU, and the remaining stages run on one CPU core. It is a source build: there is no wheel yet, and the maintained build helper `tools/symmetrix_build.py` does not have a Metal option.

## Requirements

- An Apple silicon Mac (M1 or newer) on macOS 13 or newer. Intel Macs are not supported.
- Xcode Command Line Tools, which provide the Clang compiler and the Metal runtime compiler. The full Xcode application is not required.
- Homebrew `gcc`, which provides `gfortran` for the BLAS detection of the CPU host build. The build finds it without further options.
- `git` and [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

```bash
xcode-select --install          # skip if already installed
brew install gcc uv
```

## Build and install

On Apple silicon the ordinary install builds the Metal layer; no build options are needed. The commands below clone the branch with its submodules, create a fresh virtual environment, and build the extension, which takes a few minutes. The `mace` extra installs `mace-torch`, which is needed only to convert models.

```bash
git clone --recursive --branch metal https://github.com/deng-group/symmetrix-xl.git
cd symmetrix-xl
uv venv --python 3.12 .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install "./symmetrix[mace]"
```

The Mac build uses the Kokkos Serial host backend with Apple's Accelerate BLAS, and Linux builds are unaffected. To rebuild after pulling new commits, rerun the install with `--reinstall-package symmetrix-xl`.

## Try it

`benchmarks/metal_md_demo.py` downloads MACE-MP-0b medium on first use, runs the same short MD on the CPU and on the GPU, and prints the throughput of both and their agreement on the starting structure:

```bash
python benchmarks/metal_md_demo.py
```

## Convert a model

Symmetrix evaluates a JSON export of a MACE model. For example, for MACE-MP-0b medium:

```bash
curl -L -o mace_agnesi_medium.model \
  https://github.com/ACEsuit/mace-mp/releases/download/mace_mp_0b/mace_agnesi_medium.model
symmetrix_extract_mace --model mace_agnesi_medium.model --output mace_agnesi_medium.json
```

## Run

Pass `metal=True` together with `dtype="float32"`; Metal has no FP64 arithmetic, so the backend is FP32 only.

```python
from ase.build import bulk
from symmetrix import Symmetrix

atoms = bulk("NaCl", "rocksalt", a=5.64, cubic=True).repeat((6, 6, 6))
atoms.rattle(0.05, seed=1)
calc = Symmetrix("mace_agnesi_medium.json", dtype="float32", metal=True)
print(calc.metal_status, calc.metal_device)   # ready  Apple M1 Max
atoms.calc = calc
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())
print(atoms.get_forces()[:3])
```

`Symmetrix(..., metal=True)` raises an error if the Metal layer is not available, so a run cannot fall back to the CPU silently. `calc.metal_stages` lists the stages that run on the GPU, for example `('R0', 'M0', 'R1', 'M1')`; any stage not listed runs on the CPU. `calc.metal_statistics()` reports per-stage GPU launch counts and times. Any ASE workflow works with this calculator, including molecular dynamics; the `metal=True` and `dtype="float32"` arguments are the only change from the CPU calculator.

## Check the installation

```bash
python -m pytest symmetrix/test/test_metal_execution.py
```

The GPU parity tests download the `small-omat-0` foundation model on first use and compare Metal energies, forces, and stresses against the FP32 CPU path.

## Expected performance and accuracy

On an M1 Max with MACE-MP-0b medium (2000-atom Na3SbS4, 6.0 A cutoff with a 0.5 A neighbor skin, so a 6.5 A effective cutoff and 105,256 directed edges in the starting structure), 1000 NVT MD steps take 35 to 37 s, or about 18 us/atom/step. The same run takes 82 us/atom/step with the 8-thread FP32 CPU evaluator. The trajectory stays within 3 meV in total energy of an FP64 reference run over all 1000 steps.

Benchmarks on a laptop are sensitive to other GPU and CPU load. Animated wallpapers, video playback, Spotlight indexing, and security scanners noticeably slow the GPU stages; close them for timing runs.

## Limitations

- FP32 only.
- Two-interaction standard MACE models only. `metal=True` rejects MACEField, MACE-MH-1 (`MACE_Nonlinear`), and single-layer models, which have not been qualified on the Metal stages; evaluate them on the CPU.
- The Metal R0 stage supports spherical harmonics up to `l_max` 3, which covers the MACE-MP-0 and OMAT-0 medium models. The fastest R1 edge kernel needs a channel count that is a multiple of 32; other channel counts use a slower per-edge kernel.
- One process uses one GPU; there is no LAMMPS or MPI support for the Metal backend yet.
- The first evaluation in a process compiles the GPU kernels, which takes a fraction of a second.
