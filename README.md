In Symmetrix-XL, **XL** stands for **eXtreme scale, Low latency**.

Symmetrix-XL builds on [Symmetrix](https://github.com/wcwitt/symmetrix), a cross-platform evaluator for MACE models,
and extends it with scalable, low-latency native execution paths for CPUs and
GPUs. The Python distribution is named `symmetrix-xl`; the import namespace and
command-line interface remain `symmetrix`.

Symmetrix-XL preserves the learned MACE model while changing how its equivariant
operations are scheduled, stored, and compiled. Its execution strategy has
three main components:

1. **Memory-bounded direct execution (a).** Streamed-edge execution avoids
   retaining broad graph-wide radial and tensor-product edge state by generating
   each contribution near its point of use, accumulating it into the
   corresponding receiver, and discarding kernel-local products.

2. **Model-specialized execution with runtime compilation (b).** Symmetrix-XL
   lowers the checkpoint's fixed sparse coupling structure, coefficients, and
   tensor layouts into generated CPU, CUDA, or HIP kernels and caches the
   resulting artifact. Learned model parameters and per-system graph and
   geometry data remain runtime inputs.

3. **Tiled execution with workspace reuse (c).** For capacity-limited
   calculations, optional tiled execution partitions receivers and their
   incident edges into bounded tiles and reuses a tile-local workspace across
   three sweeps. Inter-layer state remains graph-wide, while larger temporary
   intermediates are bounded by the active tile. Persistent outputs and
   inter-layer updates are committed before the workspace is reused.

### Demonstrated scale

An FP32 NVIDIA A100-SXM4-80GB qualification evaluated energy, forces, and
stress for the standard two-layer MACE-OMAT-0 model on cubic SrTiO3:

| Execution | Maximum atoms | Directed edges | Speed (us/atom) | Sampled peak VRAM (MiB) |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| Standard | 1,373,125 | 141,157,250 | 6.330 | 79,313 |
| Extended | 13,140,360 | 1,350,829,008 | 6.868 | 80,639 |

Both used a 6.0 A model cutoff and 0.5 A neighbor-list skin, giving a 6.5 A
effective cutoff, and completed with zero fallbacks. These are workload-specific
demonstrations, not capacity guarantees.

Fixed-workspace execution traded about 8.5% throughput in this qualification
for the larger demonstrated capacity. Standard execution remains the default;
large production systems can also be distributed across multiple GPUs with
LAMMPS.

### Demonstrated speed

A matched FP32 RTX 5090 qualification compared complete warmed ASE
energy/forces/stress calls for the standard OMAT-0-medium checkpoint:

| Atoms | Directed edges: MACE-Torch / Symmetrix-XL | MACE-Torch + cuEquivariance (us/atom) | Symmetrix-XL direct (us/atom) | Speedup | Sampled VRAM: MACE-Torch / Symmetrix-XL (MiB) |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| 864 | 78,624 / 97,762 | 44.487 | 4.241 | 10.49x | 2,136 / 924 |
| 4,000 | 364,000 / 452,342 | 31.011 | 3.248 | 9.55x | 7,136 / 1,386 |

MACE-Torch 0.3.15 with cuEquivariance 0.11.0 used the exact 6.0 A graph.
Symmetrix-XL used the same model cutoff plus a 0.5 A neighbor-list skin, giving a
candidate graph with an effective cutoff of 6.5 A; the graph policies are not
identical, and Symmetrix-XL processed more directed candidates.

A separate FP32 RTX 5090 qualification measured complete warmed LAMMPS steps
for 5,000-atom perturbed cubic SrTiO3 using the same MACE-OMAT-0-medium model.
It compares the standard MACE-Torch/cuEquivariance deployment through the
LAMMPS ML-IAP package with the Symmetrix-XL LAMMPS pair style:

| Implementation | Time (us/atom/step) | Speedup vs. ML-IAP |
|---|---:|---:|
| MACE-Torch + cuEquivariance through LAMMPS ML-IAP | 12.813 | 1.00x |
| Symmetrix-XL LAMMPS pair style | 2.559 | 5.01x |

Each value is the median of three 20-step runs after warmup. Both deployments
used a 6.0 A model cutoff and a 0.5 A neighbor-list skin (6.5 A effective
neighbor cutoff); the shared LAMMPS neighbor list contained 511,932 directed
candidates. The ML-IAP baseline used MACE-Torch 0.3.16 and cuEquivariance
0.11.1. This is an end-to-end LAMMPS comparison, so it is reported separately
from the ASE-call measurements above.

### Quick Start

Symmetrix-XL supports CPU/OpenMP, CUDA, and HIP through separately packaged
backends. For a normal installation, use the published wheels:

```bash
python -m pip install symmetrix-xl
```

The base `symmetrix-xl` package provides the Python frontend and an x86-64-v3
CPU/OpenMP backend. It is the required fallback package and needs AVX2, FMA,
and the other x86-64-v3 CPU features. A CPU-only machine needs no additional
backend package.

GPU packages are architecture-qualified and can be installed alongside the
base package. The selector contains the CUDA or ROCm major version and the
device target:

```bash
python -m pip install symmetrix-xl-cuda12-sm80   # NVIDIA, compute capability 8.0
python -m pip install symmetrix-xl-cuda13-sm120  # NVIDIA, compute capability 12.0
python -m pip install symmetrix-xl-rocm6-gfx1151 # AMD, gfx1151 (when published)
```

Only install a GPU package whose target matches the deployment device. GPU
packages depend on the matching `symmetrix-xl` frontend and retain the CPU
fallback; they do not overwrite another installed architecture. NVIDIA
packages provide the CUDA runtime dependencies through Python packages, but a
compatible NVIDIA driver is still required. Use `symmetrix backend list` and
`symmetrix doctor` to inspect and verify the selected backend.

The CLI can resolve and install a published matching GPU wheel automatically:

```bash
symmetrix backend install --arch auto
```

Use an explicit selector such as `--arch cuda13-sm120` on a headless or
multi-GPU host. Automatic selection reports its architecture and toolkit
resolution, and falls back from a missing CUDA 13 wheel to CUDA 12 when that
wheel is published. If no published wheel exists, the CLI prints a source-build
command.

### Source and custom builds

Start from a source checkout to build the CPU backend for the local machine or
to build a CUDA/HIP target that does not have a published wheel:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bonan-group/symmetrix-xl.git
cd symmetrix-xl
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python tools/symmetrix_build.py install --backend cpu --cpu-target native
```

For example, detect the visible NVIDIA GPU architecture and install the
matching CUDA 13.3 backend:

```bash
python tools/symmetrix_build.py install --backend cuda \
    --cuda-root /usr/local/cuda-13.3
```

Detection requires exactly one visible CUDA architecture. If no GPU is visible
on the build host, or visible GPUs have different architectures, specify the
deployment target explicitly, for example `--arch sm120`.

On Apple silicon Macs, the `metal` branch provides an FP32 Apple GPU backend
built from source; see [Apple Metal](docs/user/metal.md).

Inspect the installed backends and test the one selected for the current
machine:

```bash
symmetrix backend list
symmetrix doctor
```

Convert a MACE checkpoint to the compact JSON format used by Symmetrix-XL. The
converter is optional; JSON-only evaluation does not require `mace-torch`.

```bash
uv pip install mace-torch
symmetrix_extract_mace \
    --model mace-omat-0-medium.model \
    --output mace-omat-0-medium.json
```

The default is the preferred universal compact export, retaining every element
supported by the checkpoint. Compact format v2 stores the shared radial model
once instead of generating pair-specific spline tables, while format v3 also
retains the complete checkpoint domain. Universal compact files therefore
avoid quadratic pair-table growth and can be reused across compositions; they
still include the checkpoint's element-indexed learned parameters. Element
selectors are intended only for deliberately restricted format-v2 deployments
or exports in the original Symmetrix pair-spline format (named v1 here);
format-v3 models reject subsets.

Run an energy, force, or stress calculation with ASE:

```python
from ase.spacegroup import crystal
from symmetrix import Symmetrix

a = 3.905
atoms = crystal(
    symbols=["Sr", "Ti", "O"],
    basis=[(0, 0, 0), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0)],
    spacegroup=221,
    cellpar=[a, a, a, 90, 90, 90],
)
atoms.calc = Symmetrix("mace-omat-0-medium.json")
print(atoms.get_potential_energy())
print(atoms.get_forces())
print(atoms.get_stress())
```

The calculator defaults to FP32 model evaluation with generated direct,
capacity-aware execution. Pass `dtype="float64"` explicitly for high-precision
calculations. CUDA and HIP backends are installed separately for a matching GPU
architecture; see the [installation guide](docs/user/installation.md) and
[Symmetrix-XL package README](symmetrix/README.md) for backend-specific builds.

### LAMMPS integration

See the `pair_symmetrix` [README](pair_symmetrix/README.md) for use from LAMMPS.

### Development Setup

Use `uv` to create a virtual environment and install the package with its test dependencies:

```bash
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e "./symmetrix[test]"
```

Run Python formatting and lint checks with `uvx pre-commit run --all-files`.
